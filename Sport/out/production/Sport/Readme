This program has many different methods and characteristics that can be found within a sport. It has two (trees) the
Player part, and the Sport Team tree.

The player part has three classes, one as the abstract class Player and then there
are currently two sports players that are added, Baseball and Soccer. Both players have a set position method
as required by Player. Each player additionally has their own methods that are a characteristic of their sport.
For example the Baseball player class has getERA while the SoccerPlayer class has getGoals.

The Sport Team tree begins with an interface SportTeam, and is currently followed by two sub-classes,
Baseball and Soccer. The Baseball class has two different sorts to sort the BA, Slugging, OBP, ERA and also has
a binary search that looks for a number of homeRuns and to see if a player has that amount of homeRuns. The Soccer
class has a Bubble Sort to sort based on Most Goals.Both Sports also hold a field of players and use searches to
add to the field, and check to make sure that they are empty before adding them.

The main goal of this program is to create a team of players for a specific Sport.



The Abstract Player class displays specific methods that must be implemented by a Sport Player as well as setting
and accessing the player name through the constructor.

The Baseball Player class describes a player and creates methods to add and get the different statistics of a
Baseball player such as NumHomeRuns or Batting Average as well as a choice of different positions that can be
found on a Baseball Field such as P or 1B.

The SoccerPlayer class describes a player and creates methods add and get the different statistics of a
SoccerPlayer player such as NumGoals as well as a choice of different positions that can be found on a Soccer Field
such as Forward or Goal Keeper.

The SportTeam Interface displays methods that must be implemented by a specific Sport.

The Baseball class implements all SportTeam methods and has certain searches and sorts that only apply to a Baseball
team such as sort based on BA or Slugging or search for a certain number of HomeRuns as well as creating a heatMap of
playerNumbers. It also adds or removes up to the 9 players that can be found on the Baseball field.

The Soccer class implements all SportTeam methods and has certain searches and sorts that only apply to a Baseball
such as sort based on Goals as well as creating a heatMap of playerNumbers. It also adds or removes up to the 11
players that can be found on the Soccer field.

The Unit Test has 5 tests. 1player() (runs through 1 baseball player and 1 soccer player),
testingBinarySearch() (Runs through and searches for a specific number of HomeRuns)
fullTeamBaseball() (runs through a full team of Baseball Players)
fullTeamSoccer() (runs through a full team of Soccer Players)
testingHashMap(); (Tests the HashMap of Players and Players numbers)
